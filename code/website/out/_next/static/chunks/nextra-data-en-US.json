Generative AI systems use generative models such as large language models to produce data based on the training data set that was used to create them.\n\nNotable generative AI systems include ChatGPT, a chatbot built by OpenAI using the GPT-3 and GPT-4 large language models, and Bard, a chatbot built by Google using the LaMDA model. Other generative AI models include artificial intelligence art systems such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DALL-E.\n\nGenerative AI has potential applications across a wide range of industries, including software development, marketing, and fashion. Investment in generative AI surged during the early 2020s, with large companies such as Microsoft, Google, and Baidu as well as numerous smaller firms developing generative AI models.\nGenerative artificial intelligence - wikipedia","what-we-are-going-to-do#What We Are Going to Do":"We provide AI services to give ideas for the chef to create food plating.","some-test-results#Some Test Results":"","totally-imaginary-combinations#Totally Imaginary Combinations":"","prompt-with-chef-name#Prompt with Chef Name":"キャビア 甲殻類のジュレになめらかなカリフラワーのクレーム by Martin Yan in Nordic plating\n\n\n\nすきやばし次郎が作るキャビア 甲殻類のジュレになめらかなカリフラワーのクレーム","prompt-with-style#Prompt with Style":"","noma-scandinavian-uni-signature-dishes#Noma Scandinavian Uni Signature Dishes":"","prompt-with-combinations#Prompt with Combinations":"","eggplant-bonito-green-french-style-appetizer#Eggplant Bonito Green French Style Appetizer":"","salmon-apple-ginger-yuzu-appetizer-innovative#Salmon Apple Ginger Yuzu Appetizer Innovative":"","synthetic-pic-comparison--vs-real-pic#Synthetic Pic Comparison  vs Real Pic":"","joel-robuchon-uni-signature-dishes#Joel Robuchon Uni Signature Dishes":"","generative-ai#Generative Ai":"","real#Real":"","wild-mushroom-autumn-appetizer#Wild Mushroom Autumn Appetizer":"With season key word!","generative-ai-1#Generative Ai":"","real-1#Real":""}},"/archive":{"title":"Blog - Archive","data":{"":""}},"/blog/tag/[tag]":{"title":"Blog","data":{"":""}},"/":{"title":"A Cat knows human language","data":{"":""}},"/tag":{"title":"Blog - Tag","data":{"":""}}}
