## Chapter 1 Create Serverless Applications

### Section 1

Microsoft Azure provides several different ways to host and execute code or workflows without using Virtual Machines (VMs) including Azure Functions, Microsoft Power Automate, Azure Logic Apps, and Azure WebJobs.

> Business processes modeled in software are often called workflows.

#### Design First Approach

> When business analysts discuss and plan a business process, they may draw a flow diagram on paper. We call this approach a design first approach.

##### Azure Logic Apps

One reason why Logic Apps is so good at integration is that over 200 connectors are included.

> A connector is a Logic Apps component that provides an interface to an external service.

For example, the Twitter connector allows you to send and retrieve tweets while the Office 365 Outlook connector lets you manage your e-mail, calendar, and contacts.

If you have an unusual or unique system that you want to call from a Logic Apps, you can create your own connector if your system exposes a rest API.

##### Azure Logic Apps

Microsoft Power Automate is a service that you can use to create workflows, even when you have no development or IT pro experience.

There are four different types of flow that you can create.

- Automated, a flow that is started by a trigger from some event.
  - For example, the event could be the arrival of a new tweet or a new file being uploaded.
- Button.
  - Use a button flow to run a repetitive task with a single click from your mobile device.
- Scheduled, a flow that executes on a regular basis.
- Business process, a flow that models or business process.
  - Such as the stock ordering process or the complaints procedure.

> Under the hood, Microsoft Power Automate is built on Logic Apps.

#### Code-first Technologies

##### Azure WebJobs

Web jobs are a part of the Azure app service that you can use to run a program or script automatically.

There are two kinds of web job.
- The continuous Web jobs run in a continuous loop.
  - For example, you could use a continuous Web job to check shared folder for a new photo.
- The triggered web jobs run when you manually start them or on a schedule to determine what actions your web jobs takes.

> With Web Jobs, you pay for the entire VM or App Service Plan.
